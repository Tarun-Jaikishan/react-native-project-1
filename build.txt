### EAS

I'll provide instructions for building your app using EAS (Expo Application Services). Here's a step-by-step guide:

## Setting up EAS Build

1. First, install the EAS CLI:
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

2. Log in to your Expo account:
```bash
eas login
```

3. Initialize EAS in your project:
```bash
eas build:configure
```

## Building your Android App

4. Create a build for Android:
```bash
# For internal testing APK
eas build --platform android --profile preview

# For production-ready AAB (Google Play)
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## Common build profiles

EAS uses different profiles for different build types. Here's what the automatically generated `eas.json` typically looks like:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Advanced options

- To build for internal distribution with custom config:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile development
```

- To specify a specific Android version code:
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production --auto-submit --android-version-code 5
```

- To get build logs in real-time:
```bash
eas build:list
eas build:logs
```

Once the build completes, you'll get a URL to download your APK or AAB file. The APK can be installed directly on Android devices, while the AAB is for Google Play Store submission.

Would you like me to provide any additional details about specific EAS build options?
